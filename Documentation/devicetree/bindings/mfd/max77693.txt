Maxim MAX77693 multi-function device

MAX77693 is a Multifunction device with the following submodules:
- PMIC,
- CHARGER,
- LED,
- MUIC,
- HAPTIC

It is interfaced to host controller using i2c.
This document describes the bindings for the mfd device.

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "maxim,max77693".
- reg : Specifies the i2c slave address of PMIC block.
- interrupts : This i2c device has an IRQ line connected to the main SoC.
- interrupt-parent :  The parent interrupt controller.

Optional properties:
- regulators : The regulators of max77693 have to be instantiated under subnod
  named "regulators" using the following format.

	regulators {
		regualtor-compatible = ESAFEOUT1/ESAFEOUT2/CHARGER
		standard regulator constratints[*].
	};

	[*] refer Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

- haptic : The MAX77693 haptic device utilises a PWM controlled motor to provide
  users with tactile feedback. PWM period and duty-cycle are varied in
  order to provide the approprite level of feedback.

 Required properties:
	- compatible : Must be "maxim,max77693-hpatic"
	- haptic-supply : power supply for the haptic motor
	[*] refer Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt
	- pwms : phandle to the physical PWM(Pulse Width Modulation) device.
	 PWM properties should be named "pwms". And number of cell is different
	 for each pwm device.
	 To get more informations, please refer to documentaion.
	[*] refer Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pwm/pwm.txt

Example:
	max77693@66 {
		compatible = "maxim,max77693";
		reg = <0x66>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpx1>;
		interrupts = <5 2>;

		regulators {
			esafeout@1 {
				regulator-compatible = "ESAFEOUT1";
				regulator-name = "ESAFEOUT1";
				regulator-boot-on;
			};
			esafeout@2 {
				regulator-compatible = "ESAFEOUT2";
				regulator-name = "ESAFEOUT2";
				};
			charger@0 {
				regulator-compatible = "CHARGER";
				regulator-name = "CHARGER";
				regulator-min-microamp = <60000>;
				regulator-max-microamp = <2580000>;
					regulator-boot-on;
			};
		};

		haptic {
			compatible = "maxim,max77693-haptic";
			haptic-supply = <&haptic_supply>;
			pwms = <&pwm 0 40000 0>;
			pwm-names = "haptic";
		};
	};
