	bool "ams AS3722 power-off driver"
	depends on MFD_AS3722 && POWER_RESET
	help
	  This driver supports turning off board via a ams AS3722 power-off.

config POWER_RESET_AXXIA
	bool "LSI Axxia reset driver"
	depends on POWER_RESET && ARCH_AXXIA
	help
	  This driver supports restart for Axxia SoC.

	  Say Y if you have an Axxia family SoC.

config POWER_RESET_BRCMSTB
	bool "Broadcom STB reset driver" if COMPILE_TEST
	depends on POWER_RESET && ARM
	default ARCH_BRCMSTB
