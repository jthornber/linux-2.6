/*
 * The cache policy makes the important decisions about which blocks get to
 * live on the faster cache device.
 *
 * When the core target has to remap a bio it calls the 'map' method of the
 * policy.  This returns an instruction telling the core target what to do.
 *
 * POLICY_HIT:
 *   That block is in the cache.  Remap to the cache and carry on.
 *
 * POLICY_MISS:
 *   This block is on the origin device.  Remap and carry on.
 *
 * POLICY_NEW:
 *   This block is currently on the origin device, but the policy wants to
 *   move it.  The core should:
 *
 *   - hold any further io to this origin block
 *   - copy the origin to the given cache block
 *   - release all the held blocks
 *   - remap the original block to the cache
 *
 * POLICY_REPLACE:
 *   This block is currently on the origin device.  The policy wants to
 *   move it to the cache, with the added complication that the destination
 *   cache block needs a writeback first.  The core should:
 *
 *   - hold any further io to this origin block
 *   - hold any further io to the origin block that's being written back
 *   - writeback
 *   - copy new block to cache
 *   - release held blocks
 *   - remap bio to cache and reissue.
 *
 * Should the core run into trouble while processing a POLICY_NEW or
 * POLICY_REPLACE instruction it will roll back the policies mapping using
 * remove_mapping() or force_mapping().  These methods must not fail.  This
 * approach avoids having transactional semantics in the policy (ie, the
 * core informing the policy when a migration is complete), and hence makes
 * it easier to write new policies.
 *
 * In general policy methods should never block, except in the case of the
 * map function when can_migrate is set.  So be careful to implement using
 * bounded, preallocated memory.
